# 🛡️ Raksha - Behavior-Based Continuous Authentication for Mobile Banking

*Hackathon Project: Enhancing Mobile Banking Security Through Behavioral Biometrics*

**Theme**: Enhancing Mobile Banking Security Using Behavior-Based Continuous Authentication

Raksha revolutionizes mobile banking security by implementing continuous authentication through behavioral biometrics. Unlike traditional one-time authentication, our system continuously monitors and verifies user identity throughout the entire banking session, creating an invisible yet powerful security layer that adapts to each user's unique behavioral patterns.

## 🎯 **Hackathon Challenge Solution**

### **The Problem**: Traditional Mobile Banking Security Gaps
- **Single-Point Authentication**: Traditional banking apps authenticate users only at login
- **Session Hijacking Vulnerability**: Once authenticated, sessions can be compromised
- **Static Security**: No adaptation to changing threat landscapes
- **User Friction**: Heavy security measures often compromise user experience

### **Our Solution**: Continuous Behavioral Authentication
Raksha addresses these challenges by implementing a sophisticated behavior-based continuous authentication system that:
- **Never Stops Monitoring**: Continuously verifies user identity throughout the session
- **Learns User Patterns**: Creates unique behavioral profiles for each user
- **Adapts in Real-Time**: Responds to threats without disrupting legitimate users
- **Invisible Protection**: Provides maximum security with minimal user friction

## 🧠 **Core Innovation: Behavioral Biometrics Engine**

### **What We Monitor**
Our system continuously captures and analyzes multiple behavioral dimensions:

#### 📱 **Touch Dynamics**
- **Pressure Patterns**: How hard you press the screen
- **Tap Duration**: How long you hold touches
- **Touch Area**: Size of your finger contact with screen
- **Swipe Velocity**: Speed and acceleration of gestures
- **Multi-touch Behavior**: How you use multiple fingers

#### 🏃 **Motion Analytics**
- **Device Orientation**: How you typically hold your phone
- **Movement Patterns**: Walking, sitting, or stationary usage
- **Accelerometer Data**: Device shake and movement intensity
- **Gyroscope Patterns**: Rotation and tilt behaviors


### **How Continuous Authentication Works**

1. **Profile Building Phase**
   - Initial behavioral pattern learning during first few sessions
   - Creates baseline behavioral profile unique to each user
   - Establishes normal interaction patterns and preferences

2. **Continuous Monitoring Phase**
   - Real-time comparison of current behavior vs. established profile
   - Risk score calculation for every action performed
   - Adaptive threshold adjustment based on transaction sensitivity

3. **Response & Protection Phase**
   - Low Risk: Seamless banking experience continues
   - Medium Risk: Additional verification prompts (PIN, OTP)
   - High Risk: Session lockdown and fraud prevention measures
